        <h1>Hi! I'm Habib!</h1>
       
            <p>Wellcome to my <strong>TRAVEL'S BLOG!</strong> When I started traveling, I made a lot of poor choices. <br>I made a lot of mistakes. I had absolutely no clue how to plan a trip. I got last all the time,<br> got scammed all the time, and ended up spending way more than I should. I created this <br> blog to provide FREE TRAVEL GUIDES so you won't have to make the same mistakes.</p>
